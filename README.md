# PixelBoom

Hello, I'm Szymon, and if you're here, it means you've found my engine! Congratulations!
I made the engine in C ++ and SFML. I plan to develop it, add many features, etc.
I have huge plans for this engine but I don't know if time will allow it.

# Compilation
Unfortunately, the engine demo can be compiled for Windows and Linux.
First create a build folder. To compile a demo, go to the engine folder and type make in the console. Next step is run app.exe in build folder.
